You have all of your mandatory and recommended artifacts ready. Now you need to gather all of it in one electronic package.

## Mandatory Artifacts Examples

### Readme Artifact

As a starting point, logically organize the Readme document in chronological order of the development artifacts. Existing IEPD master documents can be used as a general guide. The Readme document can be a simple-text file and should not include XML code.

{:.example}
>The following is a recommended, general-purpose table of contents.
>
>1. Executive Summary
>1. [Name] Information Exchange
>       - Overview of the [Name] Exchange
>       - Exchange Partner Interaction
>1. Business Models
>1. Business Rules and Requirement
>1. Exchange Content Model
>1. Development Information
>       - IEPD Definition
>       - Tools and Methodologies
>       - Testing and Conformance
>1. Appendices
>       - List of IEPD Artifacts
>       - IEPD Catalog

### Change Log Artifact

The Change Log can be a simple-text file.

{:.example}
>| Version | Date | Description | Author |
>| --- | --- | --- | --- |
>| 1.0 | 2/2/03 | Original Version | Bob |
>| 1.1 | 4/16/03 | Added new elements to subset schema. | Bill |
>| 2.0 | 5/9/18 | Updated requirements and constraint schema. | Sara |

## Assemble the IEPD

Once all the artifacts have been compiled, the next step is to properly name, file, and archive the final package.

A standardized file structure promotes consistency and creates logical navigation through a large number of IEPD artifacts. Moreover, this consistency enables a greater degree of discovery and IEPD reuse because you can easily access information in a structured and uniform manner. Note that the catalog enables IEPD developers to locate artifacts in a directory and label them as specific IEPD artifacts no matter where they exist in the package.

1. **Name** each artifact for your exchange with a consistent naming convention.
2. **File** each artifact in a logical, consistent folder structure.
3. **Archive** (e.g., zip) the file structure, including artifacts, into the final package.

The following example shows a recommended IEPD folder structure and file location.

{:.note}
>The documentation produced by the [SSGT](/reference/tools/ssgt/) creates some of the structure for you.

{:.example}
>The root directory name should be meaningful and include the NIEM version and a revision number.
>
>my-iepd-4.0-rev-04
>
>- base-xsd
>   - extension
>      - *extension.xsd
>   - niem
>      - niem-core/4.0
>      - proxy/xsd/4.0
>      - utility
>         - appinfo/4.0
>         - conformanceTargets/3.0
>         - structures/4.0
>      - wantlist.xml
>      - xml-catalog.xml
>   - xml-catalog.xml (references extension uri and nextCatalog niem/xml-catalog.xml)
>- documentation (miscellaneous, binaries)
>- iep-sample (contains sample xml instances; must be in root directory)
>- mpd-catalog.xml (must be in root directory)
>- changelog.txt (.md, .htm, .pdf; must be in root directory)
>- readme.txt (.md, .htm, .pdf; must be in root directory)
>- conformance-assertion.txt (.md, .htm, .pdf; should be in root directory)
>- schematron (if Schematron is used; should be in root directory)

## Review the IEPD

You should perform a peer review of your IEPD. This has several benefits:

- Maintains consistent quality of artifact content and presentation.
- Decreases the occurrence of published IEPDs that are difficult to reuse.
- Peer participation in a review also increases individual knowledge of information exchanges and promotes accountability in verifying that the exchange meets established requirements.

A good way to review an IEPD is to compare it to a checklist. The checklist should include the following:

- The readme document contains documentation necessary to effectively describe the information exchange.
- The exchange content model file is included and accurately represents the XML code in the schemas.
- The XML catalog validates with the NIEM Model Package Description (MPD) catalog schema (XSD) and resides in the root directory of the MPD bearing the file name “mpd-catalog.xml.”
- The change log is in the root directory of the IEPD, begins with the substring “changelog,” and records changes to previous IEPD schemas that are represented.

Once you have assembled all required artifacts proceed to the [Publish and Implement](/training/iepd-developer/publish-and-implement/ "Publish and Implement") phase.
