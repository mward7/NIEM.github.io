## In the Beginning

You observe a person who displays superhuman powers (a superhero). You want to inform others of this person's presence and unique characteristics.

## Scenario Planning

Scenario Planning is the first step in the IEPD development process.

You talk to personal and professional associates and decide the information should be distributed so that others may learn, or be able to add to the group's knowledge, about the superhero.

Determine the information that would be useful to gather and the resources needed to obtain and distribute the information. To help visualize the information flow and content, you can develop a [diagram](/training/iepd-developer/scenario-planning/ "Use Case, Business Process, or Sequence") to graphically show the actors and information flow for your scenario. A visual representation can be very useful especially if the scenario is complex.

You decide that acquiring and distributing the person's name is enough.

{:.note}
>The NIEM data model is very large. It is highly likely that the type and format of the data you want to acquire and distribute is already defined. If not, then one of the several [NIEM Communities]({{ site.data.links.niem_communities }} "NIEM Communities") may have tackled a similar problem and developed an information exchange package (IEP) that comes close to meeting your needs. A search through their published resources can help.

{:.example}
>Scenario Information Acquisition and Flow
>
>1. Witness sees a Superhero display powers.
>1. Witness obtains the Superhero's name.
>1. Witness distributes information to other parties.

## Analyze Requirements

After Scenario Planning, you want to analyze the scenario's requirements for the next step in the IEPD development process.

The information exchange scenario now needs to be broken down into finer detail to understand and document the business context and data requirements. There is no prescribed way to to do this, nor is the knowledge of NIEM or XML Schema required. The most important idea to keep in mind is that the subject matter experts capture the requirements and analysis with thorough detail.

The first item you need to determine is the single, main, focal point or purpose for the exchange. This is technically known as the root element. For this simple IEPD, that is the superhero.

{:.example}
> root element = `Person`. Assume the superhero is a human person.

The content portion of the requirements analysis can be done however you prefer: document, spreadsheet, or model diagram.  The kinds of information to capture include the following:

- Data elements – These are the data fields for the message.  For each field, the following information may or will be needed:
  - Element name – This is the name of the field or tag.  Examples include First Name, Last Name, Street Address, and Phone Number.
  - Data type – The structural representation or format of the element. Examples include string, date, integer, decimal, Boolean, state code set, person data type, location data type.
  - Definition – Descriptive definitions will be required for all components in the exchange. At this stage, the semantics need to be captured, but the wording does not have to be finalized or perfected. If you determine later that an element maps to NIEM, then the NIEM element will come with its own definition. The definition captured here should be sufficient enough so that the meaning is clear.
  - Occurrence constraints – The minimum and maximum number of times an element may appear in the instance. For example, Last Name may occur once only; Social Security Number (SSN) may occur 0 to 1 times; Phone Number may occur 0 to many times.

    Default occurrence constraints in NIEM are 0 to unbounded (with a few exceptions); the default in XML Schema is once only.  Without explicitly setting these occurrence constraints, the defaults mean that components reused from NIEM will be optional and the ones added locally will be required.
  - Source information – Optional. It may be useful or necessary in some cases to record the source of the requirement. Traceability information may seem very apparent at the time but can be difficult to reconstruct at a later date if needed.

{:.note}
>If a corresponding NIEM element is already known at this stage, then the NIEM values may be used in place of local ones for element name, data type, and definition.

- Objects and classes – These are the complex, reusable data structures where related elements are grouped together.  Examples include Person (with elements First Name, Last Name, SSN, and Phone) and Location (with elements Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code).
- Code sets – This is a list of allowable values, such as a state code list or an eye color list.  Code sets may come from a standard or may be custom-defined.
- Conditions and business rules – There may be certain restrictions on the content that need to be represented.  Examples include restrictions on individual values (such as a number that cannot be less than zero or a string that must have a certain number of characters) and conditional restraints (such as if the SSN is not provided, then Last Name and Birth Date are required), etc.

The other requirements of the exchange (e.g., technical, security and privacy, performance, reporting) should be described in this stage as well.

## Map and Model Requirements

After you have analyzed and determined your exchange requirements, you proceed to [map and model](/reference/iepd/lifecycle/map-and-model/) them for the next step in the IEPD development process.

A common way begin the creation of IEPD components for your exchange is to create a mapping document. This is typically a spreadsheet, which maps your local exchange data elements to the NIEM data model. You can [download a sample spreadsheet](/training/iepd-developer/map-and-model/assets/SampleEmptyMappingDocument.xlsx "Sample Mapping Document") and modify it to suit your requirements.

The [Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)](/reference/tools/ssgt/ "Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT)") is a good tool to use to map your exchange to NIEM. If you are unfamiliar with the SSGT, refer to [Map and Model Training](/training/iepd-developer/map-and-model/ "Map and Model Training"), "What is a Mapping Document." The SSGT's advantage lies in that you can extract just what you need from NIEM, i.e., create a subset.

{:.tip}
>To find matches for your local components, use common words or acronyms in the search box.  Local names will be much less likely to return results.  A search term like "FirstName" or "First_Name" will return empty because these exact terms do not appear in any NIEM names or definitions; a search for "First Name" will return the matching component, `nc:PersonGivenName`, based on a match in the definition.

{:.example}
>
>SSGT search results are sorted by namespace (e.g., **hs:**, **j:**, **nc:**, and so on). The results list can be very long. Take your time looking through it.
>
>1. A search of "Property" for "Person" shows `nc:Person` which is of `nc:PersonType`.
>1. Browse through `nc:PersonType`, and you see it contains `nc:PersonName` which is of `nc:PersonNameType`.
>1. Browse through `nc:PersonNameType`, and you see it contains `nc:PersonGivenName` and `nc:PersonSurName`. These look like they should fit with our model and are as far as we need to search for the time being.

We have enough information from the preceding example, to [fill in a mapping document](/training/iepd-developer/map-and-model/). Make certain you have your SSGT searches handy so you can fill in the spreadsheet.

### Source Data Columns

- Source Container Type - Person
- Source Element - Person
- Source Data Type - string
- Source Element Definition - a superhero who is also a human being
- Source Element Cardinality - one person, one name

### NIEM Data Columns

- NIEM Element - `nc:Person`
- NIEM Element Path - `nc:Person/nc:PersonNameType/nc:PersonGivenName`; `nc:Person/nc:PersonNameType/nc:personSurName`; `nc:Person/nc:PersonType/nc:personName`
- NIEM Type - `nc:PersonType`; `nc:PersonNameType`
- NIEM Element Definition - A human being
- NIEM Element Cardinality - 1..1 (at least one, but no more than one)

### Mapping Column

- Mapping - Equivalent

### Simple Mapping Example

Your mapping document should look like this.

![Simple Map to NIEM](Simple-IEPD-Mapping-01.png "Simple Map to NIEM")

### Generate Subset Schema

For the final step in this phase, [use the SSGT](/training/iepd-developer/map-and-model/ "SSGT Documentation") to generate your new subset schema documentation:

1. Click "Generate Documents."
2. Under "Generate Subset Schema," click "Save Subset Schema to a file."
3. Under "Generate Wantlist," click "Save current wantlist to a file." The wantlist contains all of the components added to the subset.

The Subset Schema and the Wantlist will form a substantial part of your IEPD.

## Build and Validate

You create and validate a set of exchange-specific, NIEM-conformant XML schemas that implement the exchange content model created for the exchange. Components in this phase also include other XML documents (e.g., Wantlist) generated from NIEM tools such as the SSGT.

Obtain the documentation the SSGT created for you in [Map and Model](#map-and-model-requirements). This comprises much of your IEPD for the simple exchange, in particular the schema subset.

For the purpose of this tutorial, the local exchange components all map to NIEM. In a more complex IEP, there will likely be components that do not map. These would become part of an extension schema that is included in an IEPD, and is discussed in another tutorial.

### Wantlist Example

Based on the NIEM component choices you made earlier, the SSGT produces a wantlist like the following. Note the presence of the element `nc:Person` and the types you associated with it.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<w:WantList w:release="4.1" w:product="NIEM" w:nillableDefault="true"
  xmlns:w="http://niem.gov/niem/wantlist/2.2" xmlns:nc="http://release.niem.gov/niem/niem-core/4.0/">
  <w:Element w:name="nc:Person" w:isReference="false" w:nillable="false"/>
  <w:Type w:name="nc:PersonNameType" w:isRequested="false">
    <w:ElementInType w:name="nc:PersonGivenName" w:isReference="false"
      w:minOccurs="0" w:maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    <w:ElementInType w:name="nc:PersonSurName" w:isReference="false"
      w:minOccurs="0" w:maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
  </w:Type>
  <w:Type w:name="nc:PersonType" w:isRequested="false">
    <w:ElementInType w:name="nc:PersonName" w:isReference="false"
      w:minOccurs="0" w:maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
  </w:Type>
</w:WantList>
```

### Schema Instance Example

There is no automated way to generate the schema documents you need beyond what the SSGT provides. The most straightforward approach is to copy an existing known good document and alter it to suit your exchange.

With the mapping components handy, modify an instance schema document so that it looks like the following (with values added to `nc:PersonGivenName` and `nc:PersonSurName`).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <nc:PersonName xmlns:nc="http://release.niem.gov/niem/niem-core/4.0/">
    <nc:PersonGivenName>Bruce</nc:PersonGivenName>
    <nc:PersonSurName>Wayne</nc:PersonSurName>
  </nc:PersonName>
```

<!--
After the mapping is completed, there will be a set of local components that map to NIEM and a set that does not. For the set that maps, add each of the NIEM components to a custom NIEM schema subset using the SSGT as described in the SSGT Tutorial. Save the subset to the base-xsd subfolder in your IEPD package. Make sure to keep the subset wantlist (the save file) so that changes can be made later on without having to rebuild the entire subset.

For the set of local components that do not map to NIEM, add them to the IEPD by creating an extension schema:

Create a new Schema file (.xsd) using your preferred editor.
Copy the Schema header pattern into your schema.
Add namespace prefixes and import statements for any schemas you will need to reference.
Create NIEM-conformant components to represent your local requirements.
Build new NIEM-conformant components – elements, attributes, types, code sets, associations, roles, metadata.
Augment a NIEM data type to add local components to a NIEM type.
[Extend] a NIEM data type to create a specialization (e.g., Person:SuperHero).
Create adapters to reuse components from an external standard that does not conform to NIEM.
Review definitions to ensure that they fully capture the meaning of each component. Things that are obvious to the IEPD developer may not be so obvious to future IEPD implementers.
Validate your extension schema using the NIEM Conformance Tool to check for any issues.
When finished, save the extension schema to the base-xsd/extension subfolder in your IEPD package.
-->

## Assemble and Document

You prepare and package all related files for the IEPD into a single, self‐contained, self-documented, portable archive file (e.g., zip) according to the [recommended file-and-folder structure](/training/iepd-developer/assemble-and-document/#assemble-the-iepd).

You then should perform a peer review to ensure artifact consistency within the IEPD and with other IEPDs.

## Publish and Implement

You implement the IEPD into production and publish the IEPD for search, discovery, and reuse.
