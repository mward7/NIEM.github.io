## Artifact Specifications

The artifact specifications define the normative rules through which individual artifacts are classified as NIEM-conformant.

{:.note}

> An artifact is a NIEM-conformant artifact if and only if it
>
>- has a Conformance Target defined within a NIEM specification,
>- adheres to all normative rules applicable to its Conformance Target, and
>- references the namespaces of any NIEM components used within its definition.
