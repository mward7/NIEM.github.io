The NIEM Conformant Artifacts are the substantive components created to represent the exchange data model. Typically they are packaged into several collections of text, JSON, XML, and binary files.

See a [one-page overview](overview) for excerpts of each of the major artifacts. You may also choose an item on this page for which you need more information
