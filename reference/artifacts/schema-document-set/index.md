A Schema Document Set (SET) is a conceptual NIEM artifact that
normalizes the rules and restrictions as they apply to a
collection of NIEM-conformant schema documents. This conceptual
artifact composes exactly one *Schema*, which is the sum rules
and definitions defined within the set capable of validating
Schema Instance Documents.

## What is a Schema Document Set

A conformant Schema Document Set (SET) is a collection of schema documents that together are capable of validating a conformant Schema Instance Document. A SET defines a *Schema* that may be used to validate an instance document. This rule ensures that a SET under consideration contains definitions for everything that it references; it has everything necessary to do a complete validation of instance documents without any unresolved references.

As an artifact, `SET` is only useful in the discussion of NIEM package artifacts like IEPDs or IEPs.
