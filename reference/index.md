NIEM is a data model that defines many reusable components and rules for building local extensions.  The purpose for this is to be able to create information exchanges with clear semantics and a higher degree of consistency across the community.

This section represents our *work in progress* and is part of our [training modernization](http://niem.github.io/training/). As we knock out content, we push it out to the user community for [feedback](https://github.com/NIEM/NIEM.github.io/issues) and use.
